# Germano U-Net for Hasegawa--Wakatani

This directory contains the training, standalone inference, diagnostics, and
BOUT++ coupling code for reconstructing fine-grid Hasegawa--Wakatani fields
from Germano-filtered LES fields.

## Environment

Activate an environment containing PyTorch, NumPy, Matplotlib, and TensorBoard.
For the current system this is normally:

```bash
source /gpfs/mcc/HT04543/jxc06/jxc74-jxc06/programs/miniconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh
conda activate py311
```

## Variational U-Net

New training runs use a Gaussian variational bottleneck by default. Two
1x1 convolution heads predict latent means and log variances at the deepest
encoder resolution. Training samples with the reparameterization trick and
adds `--lambda-kl` (default `1e-4`) times KL divergence to a unit Gaussian,
averaged over batch, latent channels, and spatial cells, to the existing DNS
and vorticity objective. Log variance is clamped to [-20, 10] for stability.
KL is logged as `train_kl` / `validation_kl` in CSV and in TensorBoard.

Evaluation and BOUT++ use the posterior mean for reproducibility. Python
callers can request stochastic predictions with `model(x, sample=True)`;
`model(x, return_kl=True)` returns `(prediction, kl)`. Skip connections and
the interpolated residual remain, so this is a conditional reconstruction
model, not an unconditional generator. The KL weight may need tuning for
your data, especially with normalization disabled.

Existing deterministic checkpoints still load in inference and diagnostics.
To resume their training, pass `--no-variational`. Train a new run to obtain
a variational model; existing weights are not automatically converted.

## Training

`train_germano_unet.py` recursively reads `.npz` DNS snapshots from the
dataset directory. A dataset may either contain all snapshots in one tree, in
which case the script creates the train/validation/test split, or contain
explicit `train/`, `validation/`, and `test/` subdirectories.

The supplied `run.sh` is a SLURM example. Its principal settings can be
overridden when submitting:

```bash
DNS_N=256 LES_N=128 OUTPUT_DIR=germano_training_output_dns256_les128 sbatch run.sh
```

An equivalent direct command is:

```bash
python train_germano_unet.py \
  --dataset ../../data/BOUT_runs/HW_2D/Papers/PoP23/HW_N256/fields/ \
  --output-dir germano_training_output_dns256_les128 \
  --fine-n 256 --coarse-n 128 \
  --lx 50.176 --ly 50.176 \
  --alpha 0.392 \
  --epochs 100 --batch-size 4 \
  --precision float64 --no-normalize \
  --inverse-filter filtered_dns_spectrum \
  --inverse-cutoff-fraction 0.707107 \
  --inverse-cutoff-order 8 \
  --post-filter none
```

`--alpha` is the physical Germano filter width. If omitted, it defaults to
`Lx/fine_n`. The fine resolution must be divisible by the coarse resolution.
Training with the default `--vorticity-from-potential` makes the U-Net predict
`U` and `V`; `P` (vorticity) is then obtained from the periodic Laplacian of
`V`. Use `--resume PATH/TO/checkpoint.pt` to resume a compatible run.

`--inverse-filter filtered_dns_spectrum` computes the mean radial Fourier
power of the actual filtered DNS over the training split before epoch 1. The
reference is stored in the checkpoint, and the pre-inversion filter attenuates
only U-Net shells whose power exceeds it. Set `--inverse-min-wavenumber 2.0`
to leave physical wavenumbers `k <= 2.0` unchanged. The default is `1.0`;
`0` applies spectrum matching to all nonzero modes. This threshold is in
physical angular wavenumber units (`k_x = 2*pi*m/Lx`), not a Nyquist fraction.
It affects only `filtered_dns_spectrum`; `--inverse-cutoff-fraction` retains
its separate meaning for `cutoff`.

With the SLURM wrapper, use `INVERSE_MIN_WAVENUMBER=2.0 sbatch run.sh`.
The threshold is saved in checkpoints. Standalone inference accepts
`--inverse-min-wavenumber 2.0` to override it; BOUT++ accepts
`PBOUT_UNET_INVERSE_MIN_WAVENUMBER=2.0`. Old checkpoints default to `1.0`.
 The default `cutoff` retains the
existing smooth exponential cutoff and its fraction/order options.

Important output files are:

- `checkpoints/best.pt`: checkpoint with the best validation loss.
- `checkpoints/latest.pt`: most recent checkpoint.
- `checkpoints/epoch_XXXXX.pt`: periodic checkpoints.
- `training_parameters.json` and `metadata.json`: run configuration and
  metadata.
- `training_history.csv`: losses and metrics by epoch.
- `training.log`: captured console output.
- `tensorboard/`: TensorBoard event files.

## TensorBoard

Point TensorBoard at either one run or a directory containing several runs:

```bash
tensorboard --logdir germano_training_output_dns256_les128/tensorboard
```

Then open the URL printed by TensorBoard, normally
`http://localhost:6006`. On a remote cluster, use SSH port forwarding or the
site's supported remote-visualization method. A custom event directory can be
selected during training with `--tensorboard-dir`.

## Standalone inference

Run inference on one DNS `.npz` snapshot with:

```bash
python infer_germano_unet.py \
  --checkpoint germano_training_output_dns256_les128/checkpoints/best.pt \
  --input fields_HW_run0_time501.npz \
  --output-dir germano_inference_output
```

The default `--inverse-input unet` passes the U-Net output to the inverse
Germano operation. `--inverse-input filtered-dns` bypasses the U-Net output
for that operation and is useful as an inverse-filter baseline. The inference
output directory is recreated on every run, so do not point it at a directory
containing files that must be retained.

Inference accepts the same runtime spectral regularization overrides used by
the BOUT++ interface:

```bash
export PBOUT_UNET_INVERSE_CUTOFF_FRACTION=0.707107
export PBOUT_UNET_INVERSE_CUTOFF_ORDER=8
export PBOUT_UNET_INVERSE_FILTER=filtered_dns_spectrum # or cutoff
export PBOUT_UNET_POST_FILTER=none        # none, high_order, or gaussian
export PBOUT_UNET_POST_CUTOFF_FRACTION=none
export PBOUT_UNET_POST_CUTOFF_ORDER=8
```

An unset override uses the checkpoint value. `none` disables an optional
cutoff. The selected inverse filter is applied before inverse Germano
reconstruction; the post filter/cutoff is applied afterward. The
`filtered_dns_spectrum` setting requires a checkpoint trained with that option.

## BOUT++ coupling

`pBOUT-unet.py` exposes `initFlow()` and `findLESTerms()` to the embedded
Python interface used by the Hasegawa--Wakatani BOUT++ executable. A typical
launch configuration is:

```bash
export PBOUT_UNET_DIR="$PWD"
export PBOUT_UNET_CHECKPOINT="$PWD/germano_training_output_dns256_les128/checkpoints/best.pt"
export PBOUT_UNET_DNS_PATH="$PWD/fields_HW_run0_time501.npz"
export PBOUT_UNET_DNS_INIT=1
export PBOUT_UNET_RECONSTRUCT_CHANNELS=U
export PBOUT_UNET_ALPHA=0.392
export PBOUT_UNET_DEVICE=cuda
export PBOUT_UNET_WRITE_DIAGNOSTICS=2     # save only results_U-Net/fields
export PBOUT_UNET_INVERSE_CUTOFF_FRACTION=0.707107
export PBOUT_UNET_INVERSE_CUTOFF_ORDER=8

/path/to/hasegawa-wakatani
```

`PBOUT_UNET_ALPHA` overrides the checkpoint's physical Germano width. The
Arakawa terms are Germano-filtered when `ALPHA > 0`, except in
`PBOUT_UNET_DNS_INIT=2`, which always uses unfiltered DNS fields and terms.
`PBOUT_UNET_WRITE_DIAGNOSTICS` accepts three modes:

| Value | Diagnostic output |
| --- | --- |
| `0` | Disable all diagnostic files. |
| `1` | Write all field, image, Arakawa, and animation diagnostics (default). |
| `2` | Write only field snapshots under `results_U-Net/fields`. |

At the start of every fresh BOUT++ inference, pBOUT removes any existing
`results_U-Net` directory, even when diagnostic writing is disabled.

### Initialization modes and required BOUT++ grid

`PBOUT_UNET_DNS_INIT` accepts only `0`, `1`, or `2`. Mode `3` is not supported.
Any other value causes pBOUT to stop with a configuration error.

| `PBOUT_UNET_DNS_INIT` | Initialization and runtime behavior | BOUT++ active grid |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `0` | Germano-filter the DNS snapshot, downsample it, evolve the coarse LES fields, reconstruct fine fields with the U-Net/inverse Germano operation, calculate fine-grid Arakawa terms, filter them when `ALPHA > 0`, and downsample the terms. | `coarse_n` |
| `1` with reconstruction channels | Germano-filter and downsample the initial DNS. Reconstruct only the selected `U,V` channels; unselected channels use the spectrally resized incoming fields. Apply inverse Germano reconstruction, calculate fine-grid Arakawa terms, filter them when `ALPHA > 0`, and downsample the terms. | `coarse_n` |
| `1` with `none` | Keep the Germano-filtered initial fields on the fine grid. No U-Net is used, but inverse Germano reconstruction and its configured cutoffs are still applied before the Arakawa calculation. The resulting terms are Germano-filtered when `ALPHA > 0`. | `fine_n` |
| `2` | Use and evolve the original DNS snapshot directly. No U-Net, inverse Germano reconstruction, or Germano filtering of the Arakawa terms is used. | `fine_n` |

BOUT++ `nx` includes four X guard cells, while `nz` has no periodic guard
cells. For the 256-to-128 checkpoint, use the following for a coarse-grid run
(mode 0, or mode 1 with selected reconstruction channels):

```ini
[mesh]
Lx = 50.176
Lz = 50.176
nx = 132  # 128 active points + 4 guard cells
nz = 128
```

For a fine-grid run (mode 1 with `none`, or mode 2), use:

```ini
[mesh]
Lx = 50.176
Lz = 50.176
nx = 260  # 256 active points + 4 guard cells
nz = 256
```

The domain lengths in `BOUT.inp` must match the checkpoint. A mismatch in
active resolution or grid spacing is rejected by the Python interface.

### Reconstruction channels

`PBOUT_UNET_RECONSTRUCT_CHANNELS` defaults to `none` and accepts `none`,
`all`, or a comma-separated subset such as `U` or `U,V`. With the current
two-output checkpoints, `P` is not independently predicted: it is computed as
the configured periodic Laplacian of reconstructed `V`. Consequently `U,V`
and `U,V,P` have the same effective reconstruction behavior.

Channel selection is effective in mode 1. In the current mode-0 path, the
U-Net's complete output is used, so selecting only `U` still reconstructs both
model outputs (`U` and `V`). Mode 2 ignores reconstruction-channel selection.

Other useful controls are:

```bash
export PBOUT_UNET_IMPLICIT=1
export PBOUT_UNET_OMEGA_FROM_POTENTIAL=1
export PBOUT_UNET_LAPLACIAN_ORDER=2       # 2 or 4
export PBOUT_UNET_POST_FILTER=none        # none, high_order, gaussian
export PBOUT_UNET_POST_CUTOFF_FRACTION=none
export PBOUT_UNET_POST_CUTOFF_ORDER=8
```

At startup, `pBOUT-unet.py` prints checkpoint metadata and the effective
runtime configuration. Check this output first when diagnosing checkpoint,
resolution, alpha, precision, or filtering mismatches.
